# Open Source Playground

Open Source Playground is a documentation-first repository designed to help developers learn how open source contributions work in practice.

This project focuses on the most common entry point into open source: **documentation contributions**. It is intentionally structured to be beginner-friendly while maintaining professional contribution standards.

The repository also serves as a learning ground for understanding the **maintainer side of open source**, including issue management, PR reviews, and contribution workflows.
